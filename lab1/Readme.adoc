= Introduction to algorithms lab1

These are the 1:th laboratory for the course Algoritmisk problemlösning given by Lindköpings Tekniska Högskola in spring of 2025.

== Why Go programming language

I chose to use Go language because it is something I did not know before. The labs have shown me
that it is quit an easy language to learn and that it runs faster than most other
programming languages  with exceptions on C, C++ and RUST.
