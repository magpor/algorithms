== Input

The input consists of between and test cases. Each test case begins with an integer , giving the capacity of the knapsack, and an integer , giving the number of objects. Then follow lines, each giving the value and weight of the objects. Both values and weights are integers between and .

== Solution

This is a typical recursion problem that repeats the same result. Using a memorize function to store the results of the previous calculations will make the program run faster.

Without memorize function it will be O(2^n)
